# weight-app-enhanced
Weight tracker app 2.0 - with a few improvements

Built as a very first project after having finished the MERN stack Udemy course

The app may be a bit buggy because I didn't always use redux hooks properly, which caused unnecessary re-renders and bugs.

============================================

MAIN FOCUS:
- syncing API with redux store
- using MUI custom components
- React user authentication
- creating APIs with Mongoose

CHANGES FROM THE FIRST VERSION:
- users can save their favorite exercise
- logs load on dashboard initial render
- syncing API with redux store
- private routes
- MongoDB instead of MSSQL
- users can submit only one log a day
- Material UI instead of raw Boostrap
